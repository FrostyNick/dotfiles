# Install nerd fonts

Click Download on any of the fonts in the link below; they all contain nerd fonts.
[NerdFonts Install](https://nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)

Place it in `~/.local/share/fonts`.

For my case I downloaded with cURL:
```
cd ~/.local/share/fonts
curl -OL https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.0.1/Mononoki.zip
unzip Mononoki.zip
```
