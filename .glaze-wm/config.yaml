# This config is located in ~/.glaze-wm/config.yaml
# This mimics i3 when I can only use Windows.

## Missing so far:
## - no highlighted focus (in i3 it highlights red) 

## Dependencies (Might have missing ones): mononoki font (or a nerd font, it's configured here somewhere)

## Below is all optional, for removing the default Windows bottom bar.
## (this step might not be required) win+s taskbar -> hide taskbar # this will hide taskbar unless your mouse is at the bottom of the screen.
## To persistantly remove taskbar (Disclaimer: `nircmd` is not FOSS. There could be a better solution but I haven't found it yet):
## Download here: https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd-x64.zip or https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.zip and set environment variables.
## Alternatively with scoop:
# scoop install nircmd
## After installing you can run this from the terminal:
# nircmd.exe win trans class Shell_TrayWnd 256
## To undo above:
# nircmd.exe win trans class Shell_TrayWnd 255
## For this to run on startup: Put the code with 256 from above in a .bat file and place it in one of these files:
# %AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup # For Local User
# %ProgramData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup # For All Users
